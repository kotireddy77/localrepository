The student consistently applies Java methods but needs to deepen understanding of static vs. non-static methods, refine method syntax knowledge, explore return statements, and clarify the difference between parameters and arguments.

While consistent, the student's understanding of Java methods is average. Focusing on static vs. non-static methods, correct method syntax, return statements, and the roles of parameters and arguments will strengthen skills.

Demonstrating consistency, the student has an average grasp of Java methods. Further attention to the differences between static and non-static methods, method syntax, return statements, and the distinction between parameters and arguments will enhance comprehension.
